gradle-lintrules-plugin
=======================

Lintrules is a [Gradle](https://www.gradle.org) plugin that allows you to:
- Run custom lint rules on android application projects.
- Bundle custom lint rules with AARs.

Installation
------------

To use the plugin with Gradle 2.1 or later, add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
  id 'com.kageiit.lintrules' version '1.1.1'
}
```

To use the plugin with Gradle 2.0 or older, add the following to `build.gradle`:

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url 'https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/'
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'gradle.plugin.com.kageiit:lintrules:1.+'
  }
}
```

Usage
-----

Assuming that your custom lint rules are in a project named `lint`, you can apply them to an application project or bundle them with the AAR of a library project like so:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.android.application' // or apply plugin: 'com.android.library'
apply plugin: 'com.kageiit.lintrules'

dependencies {
  lintRules project(':lint')
}
```
